# Educative.io Frontend Development - Build a Dropdown Menu

This is part of a module in teh Frontend Development course.
Here, the instructor takes us through building a dropdown menu.

A few notes:
1. The placement of the div's is to eliminate some  unnecessary spaces around the menu items when we hove over the item.  I don't really understand this point and as the instructor indicates, it's a hack.
